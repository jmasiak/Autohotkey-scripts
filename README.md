## PolishDiactric
Enable input of diacritic / diactric letters (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic)  without touching of AltGr (right Alt key). 

In some countries, e.g. Poland, there is no country specific keyboard layout. Instead the default "latin" keboard layout is applied, but right Alt key (AltGr) if pressed prior to a key for which diactric exists, then such key code is entered (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AltGr_key#Polish for further details). In situation when AltGr is not located conveniently or ones thumb is aking / disabled, this could be cumbersome.

Thanks to this script it is possible to enter diactric keys instead of usage of AltGr:
* double press a key corresponding to specific diacritic key, e.g. ee converts into Ä™
* AltGr suspend run of this script (switches to default behaviour of keyboard
;~ * special sequence for double letters within words: <letter><letter><letter>, e.g. zaaawansowany converts into zaawansowany
;~ 
;~ WHY:
;~ a. "programmers keyboard" and Polish diactric marks combined with old ANSI keyboards 101 keys (without Windows key and context key) where AltGr is unergonomically shifted to the right side of keyboard,
;~ b. all other "programmers keyboard" when one doesn't want to press AltGr.
